# Project1
My Name: Annette Fernandes
The Project: Webpage for my husbands start-up charter company. He wants to combine his love of fishing with his love of cooking.
Details of Function: When navigating through the site you will get to interact with photo's in the gallery of fish caught. Get pricing information on certain trips. Submit an inquiry for a fishing trip. You can access his instragram in two locations. You can gather phone and address on site. You can also view a fun reciepe for the week!
Technologies: I had used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Future Improvements: I want to make the gallery more interactive. Add more reciepes. Make the front page more interactive.
